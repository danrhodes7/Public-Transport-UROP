# Public-Transport-UROP
This is the repository for my UROP in public transport, where I'll be studying the London public transport network to suggest improvements in efficiency.
So far I have used stations.csv for my data but I will be using stations2.csv as this contains national rail as well.

slider2 creates a map of the station density that you can adjust with the slider
stations2.py contains the information to draw the map correctly (the order of the lines)
